    ## What is CDSS?
    
    A Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is a health information technology system designed to provide 
    physicians and other health professionals with clinical decision support - that is, assistance with 
    clinical decision-making tasks.
    
    Our CDSS uses machine learning (specifically Recurrent Neural Networks) to help medical professionals 
    predict possible diagnoses based on patient symptoms.
    
    ## How It Works
    
    1. **Input**: Healthcare providers enter patient symptoms into the system
    2. **Processing**: Our RNN model analyzes the symptoms
    3. **Output**: The system provides potential diagnoses ranked by probability
    
    ## Model Information
    
    Our system uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on a comprehensive dataset of medical symptoms 
    and their corresponding diagnoses. The model achieves high accuracy in predicting conditions based on 
    symptom patterns.
    
    ### Technical Details:
    - **Model Type**: Recurrent Neural Network
    - **Training Data**: Curated healthcare dataset with symptom-disease mappings
    - **Features**: {len(st.session_state.get('num_features', 0))} unique symptoms
    - **Diseases**: Multiple conditions across various medical specialties
    
    ## Benefits
    
    - **Improved Diagnosis**: Assists medical professionals in considering all possible conditions
    - **Efficiency**: Reduces time to diagnosis
    - **Education**: Helps trainees learn symptom-disease relationships
    - **Second Opinion**: Provides an algorithmic perspective to complement clinical judgment
    
    ## Limitations
    
    - This tool is designed to **assist** healthcare providers, not replace clinical judgment
    - Results should always be verified by qualified medical professionals
    - The system is based on statistical patterns and may not account for rare presentations
    
    ## Responsible Use
    
    This tool should be used by healthcare professionals as a supplement to clinical expertise and 
    standard diagnostic procedures. It is not intended for self-diagnosis by patients.
